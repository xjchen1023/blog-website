# blog-website
Created a memory keeping website to journal personal career development. Used HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Express.js, with blogs saved to MongoDB.

The public can see 3 pages, including "Home," "About," and "Contact." There is a hidden "compose" page where I can write blogs that will be displayed on "Home."

Template borrowed from Angela Yu.
